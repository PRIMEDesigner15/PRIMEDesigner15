  """It is important for the myjson.py module that the constructor
     have arguments for each instance component, because it will
     use this __init__ method to reconstruct arbitrary instances
     for the class from json representations in a database.
     Except for the self argument and any keyword arguments,
     there must be a 1-to-1 correspondence between parameters
     in the __init__ method and the actual instance items."""
